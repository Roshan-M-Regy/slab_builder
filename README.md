### Prerequisites
The codes provided here were used and tested with the open source MD simulation package [HOOMD-Blue v2.9.0](http://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/Downloads/hoomd/) and [gsd v2.1.2](https://gsd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). To run these codes successfully one would require these aforementioned packages installed. To use HPS interactions between amino acids we also use [azplugins](https://github.com/mphowardlab/azplugins/) which is a plugin for HOOMD-Blue.

### Usage 
1. Create folder with Simulation_with_HOOMD_release.py, stats_module.dat and one letter amino acid sequence file (.dat)
2. Move into above created folder and do the following, 
```
python Simulation_with_HOOMD_release.py seq.dat  
```

### Examples
Examples for using this code for simulating FUS LC can be found in directory "FUS_LC_example". On running the code it produces the following files, 

1. ``` start.gsd ``` : contains a file with a single chain constructed from the one letter amino acid sequence in the .dat file passed to the script at runtime 
2. ``` resize.gsd ``` : contains a file with the replicated system (100 chains) reduced to smaller box size (15x15x15nm)
3. ``` box2slab_extend.gsd ``` : contains a file with the energy minimized system in a box extended to the slab configuration (15x15x280nm)
4. ``` Production_dump.dcd ``` : DCD trajectory file with the slab simulated over 1 microsecond
